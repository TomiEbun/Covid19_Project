### ANALYSIS of COVID19 PROJECT
COVID-19, a highly contagious respiratory illness caused by SARS-CoV-2, It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has spread globally and led to a pandemic.
The impact of Covid19 has a huge influence on society, disrupting travel, commerce, education, and everyday life. Governments, healthcare institutions, and people work together to reduce impacts and promote the development of vaccines.

Global preventive measures, including handwashing, face masks, social distancing, and avoiding large gatherings, control virus spread and provide global vaccines.

In this project, I analyzed and explored covid data with SQL using Micrsoft SQL Server Management Studio.

This covid-19 dataset was sourced from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths starting from January 8th,2020 to June 28th, 2023.
